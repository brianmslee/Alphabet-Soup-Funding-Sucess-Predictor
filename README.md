# Alphabet-Soup-Funding-Sucess-Predictor

## Project Description:
Through utilizing the Pandas, Tensorflow and Keras libraries in Python, this project serves to select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures by using the Alphabet Soup funding dataset through binary classification model. The dataset contains more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The data was preprocessed, compiled, trained, and evaluated. After, the original model was optimized to achieve a greater predictive accuracy. At the end, a performance report on the predictive binary classification model was written for final evaluative thoughts.
